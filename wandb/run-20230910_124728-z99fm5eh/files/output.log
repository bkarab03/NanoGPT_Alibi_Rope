Will you buy more?
The prices on this survey rose slightly to $1,532.46, which was up from $1,488.64, or $1,487.60, which was up from $1,424.25, or $1,422.33. Both surveys show that people have, on average, one college degree, and the gap between the numbers just doesn't grow.
This survey is to help us understand the median household income and what factors are driving the gap in median household income between people now owning at least a high school education and those who are.
It is also meant to help us judge how things are changing and how they could be fixed. If you are one of those people, it seems that you are now earning less than you did in the past, and that the gap has widened. But it's worth saying that we know the median household income is higher now than it was before the survey. The gap is now so big it could be shrinking over time.
So what's the outcome?
The survey, which will take place from 9:30 am to 11:30 pm eastern on Wednesday, (Nov. 11) at the East Tennessee State Fair in Chattanooga, is intended to answer some of the following questions:
What's your income as a taxpayer? How much has your income changed over the past 30 years? How much do you think you could make in the future if you went into debt?
The survey will also give buyers an opportunity to review their options, on how they think the overall picture of their home is. Look for "small" or "large" packages with a cost as small as $4,500, and "great" or "excellent" packages with a cost as high as $5,000. A large package could include a mortgage, even if you owned your home for two years before you moved.
The offer is available until Dec. 1, 2017, at the homebuyer's market price.
